Reverse engineering the SEUCK sprite file format (.a files):

The file is 8130 bytes long.

The first two bytes are 00110000 00110000.

The remaining 8128 bytes contain 127 sprites (numbered 000 through
to 126 in SEUCK), each 64 bytes long.

Each 3 bytes represent a row of pixels: 12 pairs of bits.  21 rows
make 63 bytes.

Each pair of bits determines the pixel's colour:

00 Background  1
01 General col 2
10 Changeable  4
11 General col 3

The last byte consists of two nibbles: 0001; then the sprite's
changeable colour.

The general colours and transparency colour are not stored in the
file.
