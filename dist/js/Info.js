I had to revert a lot of code for a really cool new feature that I didn't get to work reliably. Because of that, I had to maintain two code branches and backport features into the stable version. I finally decided to put the new feature on hold and focus on others instead.\n            </p>\n\n            <h1>V1.05</h1>\n            <p>\n            - Added a brief documentation (click on help in the menu bar).\n            </p><br/>\n            <p>I didn't get any chance to work on Spritemate for months due to my commercial stuff sucking away all my free time. Also, feedback was stopping recently, which didn't motivate me too much either. Eventually I checked the traffic for Spritemate and was suprised about the steady amount of users. So I decided to dedicate more time to this project again. In any case, if you like Spritemate, you can make a hell of a difference by letting me know, either by mail ( ingo at awsm dot de ) or by sending me a tweet ( <a href=\"https://twitter.com/awsm9000\">@awsm9000</a> ). Let me know how I can make Spritemate better for you!</p>\n\n            <h1>November 08, 2017</h1>\n\n            <h2>Features, changes & bugfixes</h2>\n            - Huge speed boost when working with large sprite sets \n\n            <h1>October 30, 2017</h1>\n\n            <h2>Save settings & color palette change</h2>\n            <p>\n            Spritemate saves settings locally now. \n            It might work a bit wonky still and I know about at least one case where the code works but should not as to my understanding (but who am I to judge the developer...). \n            Anyway, the foundation for more configuration options has been layed for future updates.\n            </p>\n\n            <br/>\n            - locally saved config file<br/>\n            - this info modal will be displayed only once when new features are introduced<br/>\n            - new settings modal<br/>\n            - choose between three color palettes: colodore, pepto and custom<br/>\n            - custom palette feature lets you define your own palette<br/>\n            - zoom levels are remembered now<br/>\n            - grid on/off in editor is remembered now<br/>\n            - window positions are now remembered<br/>\n            - tooltips now have a delay of one second before showing<br/>\n            - modals are now in focus to prevent unwanted interface interaction<br/>\n            - cursor keys rotate through the sprite list instead of stopping at start and end<br/>\n            - current version number is now shown in info modal\n\n            <h1>October 24, 2017</h1>\n\n            <h2>First public beta release</h2>\n            <p>\n            spritemate is now in public beta.
