# spritemate
spritemate is a browser based sprite editor for the Commodore 64. This is a very early version of the spritemate tool and is not functional yet. Feel free to download the dist and play around with it, but there's really not much to see yet.

## What it currently does

* choose one of 16 C64 colors from the color palette
* draw pixels on a 24x21 pixel (hires) or 12x21 pixel (multicolor) canvas
* delete pixels
* check your sprite in the preview window
* multicolor and hires mode support
* grid mode on/off in editor
* window based GUI

## What it does not yet

* loading & saving as image (PNG), internal format, native C64 binary, SpritePad SPR
* pixel tools like: shift, mirror, rotate, clear, fill, copy & paste
* save window layout
* multiple sprites and sprite sorting
* C64 mode restrictions (number of colors per sprite, global sprite colors)
* double width & height sprites
* animation
* stacked sprite layers (onion skinning)
* and tons of other stuff

If you're interested to contribute let me know - happy to team up!
